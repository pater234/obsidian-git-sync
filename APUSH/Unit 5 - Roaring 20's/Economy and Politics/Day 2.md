- The Allies wanted their reparations from the Germans ($33 billion dollars)
- Dawes Plan
	- The US will loan $2.5 billion to the Germans
	- The Germans could use this money to stimulate their economy and pay back some of their reparations
	- The Allies use these reparations to invest in their own money and pay back their debt to the United States
	- It might have been better to just forgive the loans 
	- The Dawes Plan was eventually stopped in 1930 due to the Great Depression
