	- Nonviolent protest
	- Passive Resistance
	- Marches
	- Economic Challenges and Boycotts
		- Montgomery Bus Boycott
		- Create chaotic situations in cities
	- Legal challenges through the courts
		- Court rulings that the laws are wrong
		- Get the courts to force integration, one city at a time
	- Media Attention
