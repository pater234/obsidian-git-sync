**Key Points of the Korean War**

- July 1953 - Armistice under Dwight D Eisenhower
	- Technically not a peace treaty
	- No peace treaty between North and South Korea

**Cold War Theory**
- Why did we enter this cold war?
	- Necessary Response to Soviet Aggression
		- The Soviets spread communism in Eastern Europe, denied free elections, Truman's response was appropriate
		- People were oppressed by Communism, Europe benefited more from America, millions of communist controlled peoples tried to escape Communism
	- Overreaction by America and the West
		- Wanted to create American spheres of influence
		- Wanted nations across the world that would serve American capitalism
		- We utilized the world in order to create nations dependent on us
		- We became leaders of the capitalist war
		- We knew that we were stronger and created this Soviet fear in order to take control of the globe
	- America too soft on Communism
		- We were more dominant than the Soviets, and we could have stopped the Soviets
		- If we demanded that they left conquered areas the Soviets would have left
		- Truman had a late reaction and allowed the Soviets to become powerful
	- Both sides are to blame 
		- Inevitable conflict between capitalism and communism 
		- Only two countries of any influence after WW2
			- Very different ideas all around
		- Wanted to spread their ideas to other nations in order to establish control
		- Naturally going to happen due to a historical rivalry
