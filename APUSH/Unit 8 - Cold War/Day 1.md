**Beginning of the Cold War**

**American Soviet Tensions**

- The US was wary of the Soviet Union's ideology of communism
	- Communism says that Capitalism is evil
	- Capitalists abuse and take advantage of the workers
	- Communist governments take control of all production and ensure immense distribution of wealth
- The Soviet Union remains unrecognized by the US until 1933
	- Red Scare in the US after WWI
- In the war, the Soviet Union was a sort of ally to the US
	- Not a friendship
	- An alliance born out of necessity
- Lot of tension between the allies
	- Each side questions each other
	- Racing to Berlin in order to gain control of an important city

- The Soviet Union will allow free elections in Eastern European countries currently under the rule of the Red Army
- Create a post-war international organization dedicated to peace in San Francisco
- America wants the Soviets to enter the war against Japan (did not have the atomic bomb at this time)
	- Offers islands occupied by the Japanese and concessions in China for seaports and train routes
	- Some people say that we sold out China (giving away Chinese land) in exchange for a Soviet invasion
- The Soviets attacked Japan two days after the first atomic bomb dropped (fought for maybe a week)
	- Got to keep the land because they technically did fight against Japan

**American Soviet Post War Aims**
- America believes that they should not isolate themselves like WWI
- They want to be the leader of a capitalistic world, promoting world trade and rebuilding nations across the world
	- Includes Germany
- The Soviets want to punish Germany for their repeated attacks on Russia, and want to create a buffer zone of countries that they control between them and Germany if another attack comes. 

**Europe after WW2**
- Europe was destroyed after WW2
	- More devastation than WWI
- Entire cities were wiped off the planet
- Europe looks to American aid in order to rebuild and America begins to deliver
- The Soviet Union and America are the only powers left in the world
	- The United States is by far the most dominant country in the world, with an unparalleled army and economy
- The USSR and the US had conflicting ideologies and were the only ones with any influence, so the clash was inevitable

**Post War Cooperations**
- Bretton Woods, New Hampshire - July 1944
	- Two international organizations are created 
	- IMF (International Monetary Fund)
		- Stabilize exchange rates
	- World Bank (Bank for nations)

- Bernard Baruch - 1946 asks for an Atomic Energy Commission
	- The UN would control all atomic weapons and research and no nation state could independently develop them. 
	- The US and Soviet Union would veto it
		- The US vetoes it because they have the only nuclear weapons in the world
		- The Soviet Union rejects it because they wanted to develop their own weapons and did not want a US sponsored agency having control

**Nuremberg Trials**
- Trial of Nazi War criminals
- Document the crimes of the Holocaust
- Crimes against humanity, crimes against peace
- Nazis were sentenced to death, prison, hanging
