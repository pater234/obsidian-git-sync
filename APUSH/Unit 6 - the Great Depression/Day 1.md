**Economy**
- A lot of economists believe that the economy is very cyclical 
	- They say that the economy is impacted more by new technologies and ideas rather than the actions of a president
- After periods of immense growth, there tends to be a recession in the economy, and it reaches a trough
- Eventually, the economy recovers and goes past the previous peak and goes back into prosperity. 
- Generally the economy expands and grows
- Every 20 years in the 19th century, there was a major panic
	- Usually after a period of growth
	- The economy was used to this cyclical nature

**Stock Market**

**Causes of the Great Depression**
- Uneven distribution of wealth
	- There is a lot of wealth, but it was too concentrated in the upper class
	- Wealthiest 1% income went up 75%, but the average worker's income grew 10%
	- Not enough money going into salaries and wages - purchasing power of middle class dried up
		- The ability to consume goods and services went down
		- The wealth did not keep up with overall inflation. 
		- Lots of unproduced goods, goods bought on credit
- Stock Market Speculation
	- You should only make money if you invest in good money
	- If stock prices are only increasing because people are investing in general, then it is unsustainable
	- Buying on Margin
		- Stock brokers would fork over most of the money to buy stocks, and if the stock goes up, then everyone made money (huge profits on a small amount of people)
		- It is good when done in moderation, but in the event of a crash, you suddenly are in debt to the brokers
		- The Federal Reserve board tried to stop the practice (private companies kept lending)
		- When the stocks drop, people lose everything and are still in debt
	- Huge cycle of debt throughout the Depression
- Excessive use of credit
	- People were buying on installments
	- People bought past their means, and ended up in debt
	- The companies lose money because the people could not pay back their debts
	- Continues the cycle of debt
	- Too many consumer goods (companies overproduced)
		- Surplus of products that they cannot sell once the stock market crashed
- Overproduction of consumer goods
	- Purchasing power of the middle class went $\downarrow$, companies could not sell
- Weak farm economy
	- Suffered from overproduction, falling prices (products after WWI flooded the American market), high debt
	- 25% of the economy was suffering
- Government Policies
	- Allowed for all the speculative practices to occur - high lack of regulation
	- High tariffs - hurt farmers and international trade (short term prosperity for long term problems)
	- Tight money supply - the backs collapse
		- 9 million bank accounts are wiped out
	- The government allowed for such a weak banking system
	- 20% of all banks collapsed in the Great Depression
