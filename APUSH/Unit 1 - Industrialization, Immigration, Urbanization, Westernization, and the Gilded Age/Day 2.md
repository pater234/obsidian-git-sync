**Regulating the Trusts/Railroads**
- Challenging the power of business
	- Many people began to challenge the power of railroads and big business
		- They call for more government regulation of industry
- Farmers begin the charge for regulation
	- They realized that the federal government would not help them, so they went to state governments, who were directly elected by them
	- States like Illinois and Iowa begin passing legislation to stop the railroads
		- They began forcing the railroads to publish their rates
	- The Supreme Court said that what they were doing was legal, so they said that the states can regulate the trains. 
	- They later reversed Munn vs Illinois, saying that Individual states cannot regulate interstate commerce. 
	- The farmers were happy for a while, but eventually it became a big victory for railroads and corporations. 
- Politicians took up their case
	- In 1887, the government created the Interstate Commerce Act to create a regulatory agency for business
		- Creates the Interstate Commerce Commission
		- It was not a victory for the farmers, as an agency is only as powerful as the people in charge
		- It increased regulation slightly, but also removed corruption, and shut down more of the bad companies. 
			- Increased consolidation of the industry, making the monopolies more powerful
		- First example of the government listening to the farmers, but it was extremely ineffective
	- In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed, giving the government the power to break up and regulate business. 
		- The Act was also extremely ineffective 
			- Used to break up unions
	- The government responded to calls for more regulation, but both were ineffective in the period at their intended usages of regulating businesses.
