**LBJ and Vietnam**


**Rationale**
- Johnson feared losing Vietnam like losing China
	- Did not want to be painted as soft on communism like Harry Truman
	- He felt that Truman's domestic goals were undermined by the loss of China
- Johnson felt that if he didn't get involved then it would undermine his Great Society

**Opposition to the Vietnam War**
- People claim that since Congress never declared war on North Vietnam, the war was illegal
- In the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, North Vietnamese gunboats allegedly fire at US warships twice
- Tonkin Gulf Resolution
	- Johnson goes to Congress to get permission to fight off the communists
	- Congress gives LBJ a Blank Check in order to use all necessary measures to fight communists in Vietnam
- There are a lot of questions about what exactly happened in the Gulf of Tonkin in August 1964
	- We know for sure that the second incident never occurred

**The beginning of the War**
- 1965: Sustained bombing of North Vietnam
	- Operation Rolling Thunder (March 1965)
	- Dropped more bombs on North Vietnam than in all of WW2
- April 1965 - first American troops land in Vietnam
- In the three years that Johnson is present, the military presence in Vietnam gradually grows to over half a million soldiers 

**Who is the enemy**
- North Vietnamese Army (NVA)
	- Run by Ho Chi Minh - gradually fading away
- The Vietcong
	- South Vietnamese communists fighting as guerrillas with the NVA
- Mao Zedong - The guerrillas win if they don't lose, and the conventional army loses if they do not win
	- Americans grow tired of the war
- Ho Chi Minh Trail
	- Went from North Vietnam to South Vietnam through Laos and Cambodia
		- Literal road in the Jungle
	- Supplied the Vietcong all the way down to Saigon 
	- America tried to bomb it but never was able to cause immense damage

**Vietnamese and American tactics**
- The Vietcong created a complex system of tunnels for the enemy to escape after hit-and-run attacks
- America would inflict massive casualties on the enemy
	- If we fought a war of attrition, then they would eventually have to crumble 
	- It takes a lot of time to finish the war at this rate
- Search and Destroy
	- Go into villages to find the Vietcong 

**War Popularity**
- When the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed, it was initially very popular
- College campuses were initially slightly opposed to the war
- Overall, America was relatively agreeable to waging war
- The popularity dips due to the advent of TV
	- The news channels began giving body counts at the start of every broadcast
- Generational divide begins
	- Hawks that supported the war
		- Usually middle class, older individuals
	- Doves
		- The youth that was wholeheartedly against the war
- Many people believe that the Vietnam was the advent of the government distrust that continues to this day
	- The government continually says that they are winning
		- William Westmoreland - "We can see the light at the end of the tunnel"
	- People begin to think that the government is lying

**Tet Offensive**
- Most important battle of the war, especially because of its implications on the end of the fighting
- The NVA and Vietcong attacked the South simultaneously across 100 cities bases and the US embassies
- The US beats back the offensive 
	- They take every major city back
- The offensive was catastrophic for the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong, losing over 40,000 of their 84,000 people 
- The generals thought that they were about to win, and they asked for 200,000 more troops
	- Johnson says no
- The media swayed the people at home to think that the Tet Offensive was a victory for the Viet Cong
- A lot of the anger is directed at the President
	- The anti-war group believed that he was the only person that was involved in every measure of the war
		- Hey, Hey LBJ! How many kids did you kill today?

**Impact of the Vietnam War**
- Johnson was extremely unpopular after the Vietnam War
- He announces in March 1968 that he is not running for a second term
	- Lame duck president for almost a full year
- Most tumultuous year in American history
- American morale dips
	- Disproportionate representation of poor people and minorities
		- College students could defer their drafting until they graduated (more likely to be rich and white)
		- Exposed a lot of racial and economic students
			- The war was basically fought by the poor
		- Civil Rights leaders opposed the war like Dr King
			- Turned on Johnson

**Are We Becoming the Enemy**
- Mylai Massacre
	- 1968
	- Did not find out about the killing of an entire unarmed village until the early 70s
