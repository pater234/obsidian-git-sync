**Major Causes of Imperialism**

**Foreign Affairs**
- Washington stated that the US should:
	- Avoid foreign entanglements (Isolationist attitude)
- Monroe Doctrine 1820
	- The Europeans were not to take new colonies in the US
	- The US would not interfere in European affairs
	- Reaffirms isolationist attitudes

**Closing of the Frontier**
- Henry Cabot Lodge is right, we have always been an expansionist nation, and we are not afraid to fight for new land. 
- Frederick Jackson Turner and Closing the American Frontier
	- The closing of the frontier marks a new chapter
- First major cause of imperialism

**Economic/Business/Trade Interests**
- Imperialism comes immediately after industrialization
- The next step is trade
- Imperialism makes a lot of money for American companies
- Most important issue following this new modern economy  

**Global Imperialism**
- Most other major countries have already colonized much of the world
- Scramble for Africa in the 1880s ending with the Congress of Vienna
	- Most of Africa is colonized
- America starts to fear that they will miss out on the advantages of imperialism. 
	- FOMO
- The British Empire was the largest empire in the world
- The Spanish American war was fought with a dying empire

**Military/Strategic Interests**
- If we want to be a strong nation, we need a navy
	- If we need a navy we need to have the ports to support it
- The navy also protects the country, where it can be spurred into action using the new ports to launch attacks on aggressors. 

**Social Darwinist Thinking**
- Period of pseudoscience and racism
- They used unfair IQ tests and tests to prove white superiority
- There has been a hierarchy of race, where the whiter you are, the better you are
	- With this hierarchy comes a feeling of a need to take control of darker skinned individuals to save them from themselves. 
		- "White Man's burden"
	- Extreme cruelty to "lesser races" in the name of bringing civilization to savages

**Religious/Missionary Interests**
- Missionaries believe that everyone who embraces Jesus will be saved
	- Many were benevolent 
- Some were not benevolent and affected forced conversion. 

**Seward's Folly**
- William Seward was the Secretary of State under Lincoln and Andrew Johnson
- He was extremely expansionist 
- He jumped on the chance to buy Alaska from Russia when they wanted to sell
	- He was derided for spending money to buy a "worthless" land
- Alaska has extreme importance for its oil, gold, lumber. 

**Hawaii**
- Hawaii is ruled by a monarchy
- American interests begin to propagate in the islands
	- Mainly for missionaries and whaling in the beginning
	- Eventually shifts to importance for sugar
- American companies begin to control Hawaii
- Hawaii becomes a US Protectorate in 1849 
	- Hawaii was technically independent, but the economy was controlled by America
- Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani
	- Many natives, including her, were not happy with the American economic interests. 
	- She begins to advocate for Hawaii for the Hawaiians. 
- Hawaii is extremely important strategically
- The McKinley Tariff changes things
	- As Hawaii is technically an independent nation, American business interests have to pay high tariffs to export to America
- Led by Sanford Ballard Dole, American interests stage an uprising against the Queen
	- They propose a bill in Congress to annex Hawaii
- Benjamin Harrison would have annexed Hawaii, Cleveland however was anti-imperialist
	- Cleveland finds that Hawaiians did not want to become part of America and gets the Queen released from jail 
- Hawaii becomes a country run virtually by economic interests (the queen has not been put back into war)
- Hawaii is extremely important to fight in the Pacific against Spain, so it is quickly annexed at the start of the Spanish-American War. 
- Hawaiians still resent American control to this day. 

**The Spanish American War Part 1**

**Essential Questions**
- What were the direct causes of the Spanish American War

**Cuba**
- Cuba at this point in time has been ruled by Spain for hundreds of years
	- Numerous revolts against the Spanish almost every decade
- Cubans renew their independence struggle in 1895
	- They begin the use of anarchy
	- They begin to burn plantations of sugar, much of them owned by Americans
- Cubans hope that they can cook Spanish misrule using anarchy to create Cuban independence
- Americans are sympathetic to the Cubans as they were trying to cast off their own colonial overlords
- The Spanish bring in famous general Valeriano Weyler
	- They would fence in the Cubans to stop them from leaving their villages, meaning that they cannot burn fields - reconcentration camps
		- The Cubans begin to starve in the camps
- Americans see the photos and begin to deride the Spanish for their atrocities (Weyler the Butcher). 
- Newspapers are extremely important in the time period
	- What sold papers at the time was sensationalized stories. 
- Yellow Journalism
	- Take something true, sensationalize it, sell papers
- Wars sell papers, so it was in the papers' best interest to force American involvement in the war
	- Jingos wanted war
	- The papers would write stories of customs officers strip searching American women.
