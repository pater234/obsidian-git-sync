- $W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{\Delta x}$
- $W = \int_{x=0}^{x=x} F \cdot dx$
- Conservative Forces
	- Work done is not dependent on the path taken by the mass, just the initial and final position
	- Conservative forces conserve mechanical energy
	- Friction is a non-conservative force, as some of the work done by friction is converted to thermal energy
	- If a force is conservative, you can define a potential energy
- EPE = $U_e$ = $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$ 
- $F_{spring} = -kx$
- $W = \int_{0}^{x} -kx dx$
- $W = -k\int_{0}^{x} x dx$
- $W = -k(\frac{x^2}{2})$
- $W = -k(\frac{x^2}{2}-0)$
- W = -1/2kx^2

- $ME_0 = ME_f$
	- does not work when friction or work is involved
- Work done by a conservative force = negative change in potential energy
	- $W_{cf} = - \Delta PE$
- $W_{net} = F_{net} \Delta x = \int F_{net} dx$
- $ME_0 + W_{ncf} = ME_f$
	- $W_{ncf} = \Delta ME$
