**Evolution Notes**

- Microevolution leads to Macroevolution
	- Natural Selection
	- No Migration
	- Genetic Drift
	- Mutation
	- Non-random mating
- Macroevolution
	- Adaptive Radiation 
		- organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms
		- Darwin's Finches
	- Convergent Evolution
		- the independent evolution of similar features in species of different periods or epochs in time
	- Some kind of reproductive barrier is necessary for macroevolution
		- Reproductive Isolation
		- Not Differential Reproductive Success (Natural selection and microevolution)
	- Niche
		- only one organism or species can fill a niche
		- "The _niche_ of an organism is the functional role that it plays within an ecosystem"
- Darwin talks about the origin of species, not the origin of life (not how life started but how it started)
- Species
	- individuals of one group won't mate with individuals of another
	- Something must stop populations from mating with other ones - reproductive barrier
		- A common barrier is geography where if some individuals are removed for some time, adapt, and then get reintroduced, the two groups might not mate anymore. 
- There's a simple connection between changes within populations (microevolution) and a formation of new species (macroevolution)


**Bioinformatics**
- Genome - the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism
- BLAST - application of tools of computation and analysis to the capture and interpretation of biological data
- ACTG - Nucleotides (Nucleic Acid)
	- A base pairs with T (A-T)
	- C base pairs with G (C-G)
- DNA is found in a double helix form
	- Nucleotides are made up of a phosphate sugar based
	- Drawing of DNA![[Drawing 2022-10-04 13.45.50.excalidraw]]
- The sequences of the DNA create the sequences of the amino acids involved in protein creation. 
	- Mutations can cause the proteins made to be changed. 


**Speciation**
- Sympatric Speciation - Same land
- Allopatric Speciation - Move to a separate land
