**Evolution Notes**

- Microevolution leads to Macroevolution
	- Natural Selection
	- No Migration
	- Genetic Drift
	- Mutation
	- Non-random mating
- Macroevolution
	- Adaptive Radiation 
		- organisms diversify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms
		- Darwin's Finches
	- Convergent Evolution
		- the independent evolution of similar features in species of different periods or epochs in time
	- Some kind of reproductive barrier is necessary for macroevolution
		- Reproductive Isolation
		- Not Differential Reproductive Success (Natural selection and microevolution)
	- Niche
		- only one organism or species can fill a niche
		- "The _niche_ of an organism is the functional role that it plays within an ecosystem"
- Darwin talks about the origin of species, not the origin of life (not how life started but how it started)
- Species
	- individuals of one group won't mate with individuals of another
	- Something must stop populations from mating with other ones - reproductive barrier
		- A common barrier is geography where if some individuals are removed for some time, adapt, and then get reintroduced, the two groups might not mate anymore. 
- There's a simple connection between changes within populations (microevolution) and a formation of new species (macroevolution)
