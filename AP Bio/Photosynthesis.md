- Overall Reaction
	- $CO_2 + 2H_2O \rightarrow (CH_2O) + H_2O + O_2$
	- Happens six times to make
	-  $6CO_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow (C_6H_{12}O_6) + 6O_2$
- Redox Reaction
	- Photosynthesis is an oxidation-reduction reaction
		- Just like cellular respiration
	- $6CO_2 \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6$ is reduction
	- $6H_2O \rightarrow 6O_2$ is Oxidation
	- Electrons travel with the hydrogen ion
	- $H^+ + e^-$
- Plant Structure
	- Double membrane
	- Stroma
		- Fluid filled interior
		- Everything but the thylakoids
	- Thylakoids
		- Mechanism for photosynthesis
	- Grana
		- Stack of thylakoids
	- Thylakoid Membrane contained 
		- Chlorophyll
		- ETC
			- Oxidative Phosphorylation
		- ATP Synthase
			- Hydrogen (electrochemical) gradient built up within the thylakoid
			- In the mitochondria, the ATP synthase is pointed in the opposite direction
- Photosynthesis

	- Light Dependent Reaction
		- Water brings in electrons for the ETC
		- ATP and NADPH does to Calvin cycle in order to create sugars
		- Convert solar energy to chemical energy
		- Convert ADP and NADP+ to ATP and NADPH
			- Bank the cash money
	- Light Independent Reaction
		- Calvin Cycle
		- Sugar building reaction
			- Uses ATP and NADPH (Chemical Energy) to reduce CO2 (gain electrons) to synthesize C6H12O6 (via a dehydration synthesis reaction)
- Light Dependent Reaction deep dive
	- Exactly like cellular respiration
	- Integral channel proteins in organelles
	- Electron acceptors
		- NADPH
			- Instead of NADH
	- Proton gradient across inner membrane
		- Find double membrane
	- ATP synthase enzyme
		- Thylakoids pump hydrogen into the ATP synthase
- ETC of Photosynthesis
	- All membranes are made of the phospholipid bilayer
	- Photosystem II takes two waters, splits the water using an enzyme, and then O2 and protons come out
	- The final electron acceptor in photosynthesis is plastoquitone. 
	- Photophosphorylation is done by the ATP synthase
	- Photosystem I uses the NADP reductase to add hydrogen to NADPH (add hydrogen with electron)
		- Will be used by calvin cycle to make sugar
- ATP Synthase
	- Moves electrons, pumps protons, builds the proton gradient, dirves the flow of protons through the ATP synthase
	- Bonds inorganic phosphate to ADP 
	- Generates ATP
	- PSII and Photosynthesis provides the sunlight (energy)
	- Chemical evolution built this scenario
