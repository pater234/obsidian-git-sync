**Understanding Cladograms and Phylogenetic Trees**
- Cladograms and Phylogenetic Trees are hypotheses of evolutionary relationships
	- Phylogenetic Trees are calibrated using the fossil records 
- The lines represent time, where the top is usually more recent. 
	- A tree usually goes towards the right
- A node is a point of divergence/speciation
- Any traits found before divergence usually are found in all the species descended from that divergence point
- The lines represent a series of ancestors

- All agents of evolution work on Darwin's Finches - (Adaptive Radiation, speciation, reproductive isolation (geologic))
	- Genetic Drift
	- Gene Flow
	- Natural Selection
	- mutation
	- non-random mating

	- Rotating along the nodes does not change the tree

**Constructing a Phylogenetic Tree**
- Morphological, biochemical, molecular, amino acid, behavioral data and construct a tree
- Character Tree ![[Test 1 Notes 2022-10-17 14.24.25.excalidraw]]
- The trees are simply a hypothesis of a relationship - best estimate to show a relationship
- Outgroups - the lineage that is least closely related to the remainder of the organisms in the phylogenetic tree/cladogram
	- 3 2 and 4 would be an in group due to their shared derived characteristics
