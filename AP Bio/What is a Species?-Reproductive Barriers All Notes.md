**What is a Species Video**
- Biological species concept
	- Species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups
		- If there is a potential to reproduce despite a barrier they are not different species
		- For example, if two populations of squirrels are separated by a barrier but can still reproduce if brought back together, then they are not separate species
- Ecological Species Concept
	- A set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources in the environment
		- Different species have different characteristics or morphologies 
		- Different species must be morphologically distinct
- Species
	- Interbreeding
	- Don't reproduce with other groups
	- Morphologically distinct
	- Adapted to different resources
- How important is the possibility to interbreed?
	- Elk and North American Red Deer can interbreed in captivity, but would never meet in nature
	- The Polar bear and grizzly bear are held as different species, live in different environments, and look different
		- But they do interbreed in nature
	- Some species, such as bacteria, reproduce asexually, so the reproduction characteristic doesn't work for them. 
	- It does not work for species in fossils either
- Bacteria species are defined by differences in DNA sequences
- Fossil Species are defined by differences in anatomy, age, and where they were found
- Different types of definitions for species
	- Cladistic
	- Phylogenic
	- Isolation
	- Typological
	- Recognition
	- Genetic
	- Morphological
- The best way to define a species depends on what you are studying and what you are trying to do. 
- Species aren't fixed entities, they change over time
- Species can be separate, separating, or even coming back together
- We use the word species for conservation (need to define the group we're trying to protect), allows scientists to converse about different animals
- Instead of focusing on what a species is, focus instead on the context. 

**Reproductive Barriers Notes**
- Speciation can only happen if a reproductive barrier exists to prevent populations from interbreeding
- Reproductive isolation allows for allele differences to accumulate, and coincides with populations specializing to different habitats. 
- Geography
	- Freshwater lake sticklebacks were cut off from ocean sticklebacks, and thus they evolved separately into different populations
	- The Grand Canyon caused two different squirrel populations to evolve into different species
	- Flightless crickets in Hawaii began speciation as the islands formed
- Behavior
	- The greenish warbler breeds through appearance, song, and mating behavior, and thus two populations won't interbreed with those that look different in any way
	- Fireflies have distinct blinking patterns based on species, so different species do not pursue fruitless relationships
- Timing
	- Different types of coral can fertilize other coral, but most self fertilize as the gametes are ready to mate at different times
- Anatomy
	- Different types of beetle species have similar characteristics, but such different reproductive organs that they couldn't mate
- Genetic Incompatibility
	- The most commonly farmed type of cotton has different chromosomes from its parents so it can only self pollinate
	- In some closely related sea urchin species, variations in proteins prevent gametes from connecting

**Unity and Diversity of Life Notes**
- Fossil evidence tells us life has existed for millions of years, starting with simple lifeforms and then expanding to 10 to 20 million different species all coming from one common ancestor
- It takes a long time for small changes to turn into large changes that arise new species
- The pattern of branching and diverging can expand one branch into millions
- There has been enough time for one lineage diverging every 130 million years to diverge into 100 million branches
	- Lineages branch much more often than this according to the fossil record
- The first primates evolved within the last 60 million years and gave us all the species of primates around today
- A bigger cell took control of two smaller cells to begin eukaryotic life and multiple cells came together to begin multicellular life
- The duplication and divergence of genes and chromosomes give rise to immense amounts of changes.
