**Recap**
- Organism capture and store free energy for use in biological processes
- Cellular respiration uses energy from sugars (such as glucose) to convert ADP to ATP
	- Cash Money
	- Glycolysis is one part of cellular respiration
- Any autotroph typically has mitochondria
	- Plants make glucose for themselves, the glucose is going to go through glycolysis to make ATP, which can then be used by the mitochondria
- NAD+ / NADH
	- Electron carriers
- $O_2$ - final electron acceptor
	- We cannot make enough ATP through fermentation

**Cell Processes**
- The free energy in sugars can be used to drive metabolic pathways vital to cell processes
- Endergonic/exergonic reaction pairing
- Cellular Respiration oxidizes glucose, releasing energy
	- This converts ADP to ATP

**Cellular Respiration Overview**
- Cellular respiration is a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions
	- Enzymes lower the $E_a$ of reactions
- Coupled reactions
	- ATP is invested into glycolysis in order to add phosphate to the existing glucose, where more ATP than was put in ends up being created
- Cellular respiration is a catabolic pathway that yields energy by oxidizing organic fuels
	- Organic fuel in this case = glucose
- LEO says GERRRRRR
	- Lose Electrons = Oxidation
	- Gains Electrons = Reduced

**Steps of Cellular Respiration**
- Glycolysis
	- Conversion of glucose into pyruvate, NADH, and ATP
- Krebs Cycle
- ETC - Oxidative Phosphorylation

**Glycolysis**
- Glycolysis is anaerobic - not needing oxygen
	- Just needed a membrane with a cytoplasm
- Energy investment -> payoff
- Glucose -> two 3 carbon molecules -> two pyruvate

**Linked Reaction**
- Pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion
- The pyruvate has got to be converted to a different chemical called Acetyl CoA (Coenzyme-A)
- One carbon is removed from a pyruvate (which is $C_3O_3H_3$) to create $CO_2$ as a waste product
- NAD is put in an oxidized -> one more NADH
- Coenzyme A is then attached to the Acetyl and will now be used in the Krebs Cycle

**Krebs Cycle Overview**
- Also known as the Citric Acid Cycle
	- First intermediate is Citric Acid
- There are two Acetyl CoA after glycolysis and transition - per glucose molecule there are two ATP coming out of the Krebs
- $CO_2$ is expelled
- 3 NADs are converted into 3 NADHs
- ATP is created from ADP
- FAD (another electron carrier) is converted into $FADH_2$

**Krebs Cycle**
- The Krebs Cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria
	- Matrix location![[Cellular Respiration Part 2 2023-01-11 12.38.17.excalidraw]]
- Krebs Cycle produces 2 ATP through substrate level phosphorylation
	- Active enzyme that will phosphorylate ADP into ATP
- During the Krebs cycle, NAD and FAD receive electrons
	- Payoff of the Krebs Cycle - electrons are supplied to the ETC
