**Glycolysis**
- Glyco - Glucose
	- Sugar/Carbohydrate	
		- Has a lot of stored energy in its bonds
		- High energy molecule
- Lysis - Break apart
- Glycolysis does not need an organelle to complete glycolysis
	- It has been in existence for a long time
	- Glycolysis in our bodies is the same as the glycolysis in prokaryotic life
- You are what you eat
	- Whatever you put in the body will break that thing down and use it inside the body
	- If you put in bad stuff in your body, your body will become bad
- You somehow have to get ATP through the usage of glucose
	- If cells don't get ATP, they will not work
- Glycolysis happens in the cytosol
	- The cytoplasm![[Cellular Respiration 2023-01-09 13.49.12.excalidraw]]
	- The fact that glycolysis happens in the cytosol means that cells without a nucleus can complete glycolysis
- Energy requiring phase
	- Glucose has 6 carbons ![[Cellular Respiration 2023-01-09 13.53.14.excalidraw]]
	- Add in ADP ![[Cellular Respiration 2023-01-09 13.54.44.excalidraw]]
	- Splits into G3Ps (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)![[Cellular Respiration 2023-01-09 13.58.50.excalidraw]]
- Energy Releasing Phase
	- The three carbon sugars are converted into another molecule called pyruvate
	- Two ATP and one NADH are made through this reaction
	- Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the line to make a ton of ATP
	- Glycolysis makes lactic acid through fermentation
		- Lactic acid changes the pH of the body (makes enzymes unhappy) - you cannot make as much ATP (muscles cannot contract as much)
		- When you are in shape you are changing the chemistry of your body
			- Better lactic acid buffering system
- Overall Reaction
	- Per glucose molecule you would expect to get 2 pyruvate and 2 NADH's
		- 6C goes to 3C + 3C
		- ATP - adenosine triphosphate
			- The primary source of ATP in cells is mitochondria organelles
			- Oxygen is consumed by the mitochondria
		- The first reaction is $ATP + glucose \rightarrow  Glucose\space 6-phosphate + ADP + H_-$
			- ADP can be combined with inorganic phosphate (next to a high energy phosphate) to jump to ATP
			- $ADP + P_i \rightarrow ATP$
		- Glucose 6-phosphate is an unstable molecule that will break apart
		- An enzyme that will lower the activation energy that will allow the reaction to continue
		- $Glucose \space 6-phosphate \rightarrow fructose \space 6-phosphate$
		- $ATP + Fructose \space 6-phosphate \rightarrow fructose \space 1.6-phosphate + ADP$
		- $Fructose \space 1.6-phosphate \rightarrow G3P + Dihydroxyacetone$
			- Only G3P is ready to continue with glycolysis
		- Isomerization converts the other 3 carbon molecules to G3P
		- $Dihydroxyacetone \rightarrow G3P$
			- Now we have two G3P
		- $NAD_- + P_i + G3P \rightarrow 1.3-Biphosphateglycerate + NADH$
			- Adding a phosphate to G3P and giving an H to NAD 
- Input and Output Version
	- Preparatory Phase
		- Glucose goes in, 2 G3P's come out through ATP being input in during the 1st and 3rd steps
	- Payout Phase
		- 4 ATPs come out in Step 7 and 10
		- Net 2 ATP and 2 NADH in Glycolysis
		- NADH is formed in Step 6
			- Electron carrier which has the possibility to make more ATP through a process called Oxidative Phosphorylation
				- NADH moves electron through the ETC which eventually reaches oxygen - the final electron acceptor
- The exergonic reaction of glycolysis is married to the endergonic reaction which creates ATP from ADP and phosphate
