**Cellular Energetics**
- Enzymes
	- Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions
- ATP is the battery that all life runs on

- Energetically Favorable
	- Exergonic Reactions release energy
	- Example: $ATP = ADP + P_i$
- Non spontaneous
	- Endergonic Reaction require energy input
	- Example: $ADP + P_i = ATP$
- Endergonic reactions can be pushed by coupling them with a strongly exergonic reaction
	- They often share intermediates with exergonic reactions 

- Enzymes convert bonds and break down bonds in macromolecules

- ADP + P_i -> ATP
	- Adenine DiPhosphate + Inorganic Phosphate = Adenine TriPhosphate

- Food recharges ADP + Pi -> ATP battery
- Cells do not do work unless you convert food into energy
- The body will only do work if it is paid in cash (ATP)

- Photosynthesis is an endergonic reaction where energy is absorbed to form chemical bonds between smaller reactants to produce a larger product
	- Photosynthesis is a massive coupling of exergonic to endergonic reactions
