**Overview**
- Cell Respo
	- Electron Carriers
		- NAD+/NADH
		- FAD/$FADH_2$
	- The electron carriers are oxidized 
		- Oxidative phosphorylation
	- The whole point of the electron carriers is to establish a hydrogen chain
		- Proton Gradient
	- Pumping hydrogen through the Chain in order to start Chemiosmosis
- Photosynthesis
	- Electron Carriers
		- NADP/NADPH
	- Oxygen is the final electron acceptor

**ETC**
- Transport Proteins
- Electron Carriers
- And Electrons
- All working to establish an electrochemical gradient (proton gradient)
	- Pumping and moving protons against their concentration gradient
- Technically does not include ATP synthase
	- Works with the ATP Synthase

**Chemiosmosis**
- The energy to move the protons through the gradient is given by NAD and FAD
- Chemiosmosis is the diffusion of the protons to phosphorylate ATP
- The ETC and Chemiosmosis together establish Oxidative Phosphorylation

**Oxidative Phosphorylation**
- Creation of ATP through the oxidation of NAD and FAD

**Cell Respo**
- Investment
	- 1 glucose
	- Oxygen
- Payoff
	- Water
	- CO2
	- 36-38 ATP
- Visual
	- Get two ATP from glycolysis
	- Get 2 from Calvin Cycle
	- Get about 34 from ETC (Oxidative Phosphorylation)

**Energy Capturing Processes**
- Different energy capturing processes use different types of electron acceptors
- NADP+/NADPH system for Photosynthesis
- NAD+/NADH and FAD/FADH2 systems for cell respo

**Photosynthesis**
- Photosystem II is designed to bring in energy from photons and use them to add protons to the electron carriers. Establishes the electrochemical gradient
	- Will allow for chemiosmosis which will cause chemiosmosis 
- Photosystem I absorbs a photon, it uses electrons that are being shuffled through the ETC and reduces NADP into NADPH
	- Calvin Cycle will make sugar from this
	- Electrons lost from photosystem I will be replaced by photosystem II
- Photosystem I and Photosystem II
