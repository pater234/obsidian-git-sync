**Genome**
- Full set of DNA
- Made up of 46 chromosomes 
	- 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes

**Metaphase**
- In metaphase all the chromosomes line up in the center of the cell

- The gender of the offspring is contingent on the male complement
- There is more genetic information in an X chromosome than a y chromosome, so males have less dna 
- Non disjunction situation
	- The spindle cannot disjoint the two homologous chromosomes at the centromere
		- You end up getting two or one chromosome from the different poles
- Monosomy
	- Having only one chromosomes in a homologous pair
- Trisomy
	- Having three homologous chromosomes (one extra)
