- Notes on Bradstreet
	- Recognized as the first female New World Poet
	- Influenced by the Puritan desire to venture into the wilderness and the Elizabethan value of education
	- Met with distressful conditions of malnutrition and native hostility when she migrated to the colonies
- Notes on Wheatley
	- Slave to John Wheatley in Boston, lived to the creation of the United States
	- Seen as the representation of the creative and intellectual skills of African Americans for abolitionists
	- Much of her work is lost, with the ones that we have only held by abolitionists after her death.
