- The Sophistication point is the hardest to get
- Places to embed sophistication
	- Thesis
		- Recognize the nuances of the passage
		- Consider levels of complexity (possibly multiple)
		- Acknowledge literary devices that act as the focus
		- Even if the thesis does all three of things, you are not getting sophistication
			- Good place to start things off, but must be continued at a high level throughout
	- Introduction/Conclusion
		- Complicated to do so
	- Scoring Note 1 - Identifying and exploring complexities or tensions within the passage
		- Some passages have some notable devices or components that many students will recognize, but have an extra layer that most miss
		- Subtle complexities that is less frequently understood or related by students
	- Scoring Note 2 - Illuminating the student's interpretation by situating it within the broader context
		- Considers a broader historical, societal, cultural role that is then integrated into a nuanced analysis of the passage, but provides a more worldly perspective or relevance
			- Bring in stuff from other humanities, talk about the time period or perspectives
		- Shows maturity, bigger understanding of the world, may get global or noble
	- Scoring Note 3: Accounting for alternative interpretations of a passage
		- Counter-argument in Lang turns
		- Challenging in a Lit sense
			- Very easy to get stuck in the turn against and forget the turn back
		- Cannot argue both ways, make one overarching point and maybe rebut another side
	- Scoring Note 4: Employing a style that is consistently vivid and persuasive 
		- High standards
		- Maybe could write in different registers
	- Scoring Note 1 and 4 are the most common
		- 1 - saw the right thing at the right time
		- 4 - built throughout the year
- Note about the author
	- Present your interpretation of the work, not say what the author was "trying" to do
	- You are not responsible for mind reading, seances or any communication with the dead to know the author's intent
	- Only describe what the effect has been, and the choices that led to that specific effect.
