- Basics
	- Sonnets are 14 lines
		- Always
	- Classically iambic pentameter
		- Contemporary poems that play on sonnets may not have iambic pentameter
	- Iamb
		- One unstressed short syllable followed by a longer syllable
		- A type of "foot" (unit of measurement in poetry that consists of a rhythm connected to a stressed syllable)
		- Examples
			- deLIGHT (stress the second syllable)
			- reLEASE
	- Meter
		- rhythmic structure of a line of poetry, consisting of feet
	- Penta
		- Indicates that we have 5 meters
	- Math Question: How many syllables in each line of iambic pentameter
		- 2 syllables in iamb foot x 5 meters of feet = 10 syllables
- Other Feet
	- Trochee
		- Two syllables - emphasis on the first syllable
	- Spondee
		- Two syllables, equal emphasis
	- Dactyl
		- Three syllables with emphasis on first
	- Anapest
		- Three syllables with emphasis on the third, typically divided across multiple words

		- Classic rhyme schemes
			- abababab
			- abbaabba
		- Sestet - cdecde or cdeedc

			- Octave is the problem of the sonnet
			- Then comes the Volta
			- The Sestet is the solution
		- Synonymous with the idea of unattainable love
