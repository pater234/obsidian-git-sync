**Austro-Hungarian Empire**
- Made up of numerous ethic groups
- Focus on the province of Bosnia
	- Many ethnic Serbs
	- Serbia is already its own country of ethnic Serbs, and many people in Bosnia want to join with Serbia
- The tensions in the Balkans is one of the immediate causes of World War 1
	- Ethnic Serbs want independence for Bosnia from Austria-Hungary
- The Archduke (heir to the Austrian throne) visits Sarajevo to give a speech and participate in a parade
- The Black Hand - terrorist organization of teenagers trying to create a "Greater Serbia"
	- First assassin gets cold feet
	- Second assassin has his bomb bounce off of the car and now the Archduke knows about the assassination attempt
	- In an attempt to stay of the main road, they wind up in front of a final conspirator, Gavrilo Princip, who shoots and kills the archduke
**Domino Effect**
- Austria-Hungary gets mad at Serbia, blames them for the attack
	- They declare war on Serbia
- Russia is allied with Serbia (believes that they are the protectors of all Slavs), they mobilize and declare war on the Austro-Hungarians
- Germany declares war on Russia and (preemptively) their ally, France,  
- The German plan is to first defeat France by circling through Belgium, a neutral nation. 
	- Great Britain guaranteed their neutrality, so now they enter the war. 
- The Allied Powers (Triple Entente)
	- Great Britain, France, Russia
- The Central Powers
	- The German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire
- The Italians do not keep their alliance, and instead choose to join the Allies after a war. 
- Much of the fighting takes place along the Western Front, but fighting takes place in the Pacific, Eastern Front, The Ottoman Empire, and in the Middle East
- Germany nearly takes Paris in the first few months of the war, the French put forth a massive effort to defeat the Germans, and the Western Front settles into a stalemate. 

**American Feelings**
- America is very happy to stay out of the conflict 
- 35% of the country was made up of First and Second Generation Immigrants and there were concerns that they would take sides in the conflict
	- Germans, Austro-Hungarians and Irish people would support the Central Powers
	- The United States culturally and economically supported the Allies
- British propaganda
	- British media would pump anti-German propaganda into the United States, leads Americans to be more sympathetic towards the Allies.
