	- The old capitals of Central and Eastern Europe are behind that
- Europe has become divided into two polarized camps
- How does Harry Truman and the United States "fight" this war

**Containment**
- We do not want to let another dictator do whatever they want to
- George Kennan, a US diplomat, sends the Long Telegram
	- The Soviets are inherently expansionist
		- Communism cannot be sustained 
	- The Soviets will respond to military force and might, not logic
	- Prevent other nations that are not communist from becoming communist
- Becomes the main focus of every president from Truman to the 1990s

**Truman Doctrine**
- Civil War in Greece
	- Communists were trying to take control of the country
- Soviet Pressure on Turkey
	- The US was afraid that the Turkish government would give concessions in the Black Sea and the Dardanelles
- "The US should support free people throughout the world who were resisting takeovers by armed minorities" - we will give money and aid to those fighting communists and communist takeovers
- The US gives $400 million in aid to Turkey and Greece
- Popular and supported
	- Seen as Truman taking a hardline stance against Communists
- Prevented Greece from falling to the Communists and prevented Turkey from submitting to Soviet pressures

**Marshall Plan((
- Europe is suffering after the end of World War II
	- Hunger, poverty, and lack of funds
- Secretary of State was George Marshall
	- Chief of Staff during WW2
- Marshall sees that people are in chaos in Europe
- The fear was that this poverty would lead to the radicalization of the populace, leading to the fall of Europe to communism
- Proposes the Marshall Plan in order to stop this fear
- Called for initially $17 billion dollars to be outright given to Europe to rebuild 
- "European Recovery Program"
	- Not against any country of doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos 
	- Very well received in Europe
- Congress debates whether to do so or not
	- During the debate, Czechoslovakia becomes of Soviet Puppet
- Earmarks $12.5 billion to Western Europe
	- Extended to the Soviets and their satellites, but Stalin rejects this

**Germany**
- Germany is split into multiple occupation zones
	- The Allies combine their zones into West Germany and help it rebuild
- Berlin is also split in the middle of the Soviet occupation zone
- West Germany is more prosperous, and East Germans want to move West
- West Berlin is a thorn in Stalin's side, and he wants them to leave
- Stalin begins the blockade of West Berlin
	- All land entrances into West Berlin would be blocked, and they would starve the West Berliners
	- First Cold War crisis
- America does not want to leave Berlin, so they begin an airlift of Berlin
	- Planes would leave by the minute to drop supplies into Berlin
	- Genuine fear that the Soviets would shoot the planes down, but the Soviets did not want to fight as the US had nuclear bombs
	- Very popular around the globe, vilifies the Soviets further 
- After 11 months, Stalin lifts the blockade of West Berlin
- Leads to the permanent division of Germany 
	- West and East

- After WW2, there was a lot of sympathy for the Jews in the original Holy Land
- The UN created the state of Israel after WW2
	- Originally supposed to be Israel and Palestine 
- Surrounding Arab states opposed the state of Israel and eventually attacked Israel
	- Israel wins and takes some of the Palestinian land
- Truman's advisors say that it is better to not recognize Israel because it would conserve the relationship between the US and the Arab states.
