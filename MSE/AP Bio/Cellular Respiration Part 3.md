**Electron Transport Chain**
- embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane
- Electrons expelled from the Krebs Cycle are carried by NADH and $FADH_2$ to ETC
- These electrons are passed from carrier to carrier until they reach oxygen, where it forms 2 $H_2O$
- The energy from the passing of electrons is used to pump protons into the inter membrane space, forming an electrochemical gradient
- The protons diffuse through the ATP synthase, which uses energy from the gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP through a process called Oxidative Phosphorylation.
- Different processes use different types of electron acceptors
	- NADP+ for photosynthesis
	- Oxygen for cellular respiration

**Fermentation**
- In the absence of oxygen - ATP production continues
	- Called fermentation
		- Another pathway that cellular respiration can take
- Two Major types of fermentation
	- Lactic Acid Fermentation
	- Ethanol Fermentation
		- Most beers and wines are fermented from yeast through ethanol fermentation
- Fermentation produces ATP through substrate level phosphorylation when the ETC cannot run due to lack of oxygen
- The whole point of fermentation is to restore the NADH
- Glucose turns into pyruvate which turns into lactate 
	- Accepts electrons from NADH
