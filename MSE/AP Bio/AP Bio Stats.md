**Standard Deviation**
- Normal Distribution
	- Also called a bell curve ![[AP Bio Stats 2022-11-02 13.55.14.excalidraw]]
	- $\bar x$ is the mean (Average)
	- The standard deviation will measure the spread or variation of the data
	- All answers must be within $\pm$ 2 standard errors or within a 95% confidence interval
- The Standard Deviation will vary based on the data that you have
- Greater Spread = Greater Standard Deviation
- Standard Deviation Equation
	- $s = \sqrt \frac{\sum(x - \bar x)^2}{n-1}$ 

**Standard Error**
- "Standard Deviation measures the spread of your data, Standard Error deals with how accurate it is". 
- Error Bars are graphical representations of Standard Error which is found based on Standard Deviation
- Standard Error of the mean formula
	- $SE_{\bar x} = \frac{s}{\sqrt n}$ 
- Standard Error is a measure of precision - can we trust our data
- Error Bars example ![[AP Bio Stats 2022-11-02 14.28.04.excalidraw]]
- If the errors bars do not overlap then you can claim that the data is statistically significant
- If they do overlap then you cannot claim a statistically significant difference
