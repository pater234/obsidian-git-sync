**Mendel's experiments**
- Mendel crossed a white plant with a purple plant and ended up getting a bunch of purple plants
	- He decided to cross these purple plants with each other
- Over time, he got a ratio of 3 purple plants to 1 white plant 
- Monohybrid cross 
	- 25% chance of PP (Purple)
	- 50% chance of Pp (Purple)
	- 25% change of pp (White)
- He first looked at the data for shape and color simultaneously 
	- Got 9:3:3:1
	- Decided to look at single data sets
	- He found 12 round and 4 wrinkled (3:1) ratio
	- He found 12 yellow and 4 green (3:1) ratio
- He determined that color allele did not affect the assortment of the alleles
- Created the law of independent assortment
	- A 9:3:3:1 ratio has two 3:1 ratios
- This all changes if the alleles are linked (close to 1 another on the same chromosome) then they will not follow Mendelian law
- Major Non-Mendelian Inheritance Patterns
	- Codominance 
		- Both alleles are dominant
		- If a white cow is crossed with a brown cow then all of the offspring will be brown with white spots
		- Both of alleles are expressed together in the phenotype
	- Incomplete dominance
		- Neither allele is dominant 
		- Blending between the two
		- A red and white flower cross would create a blue flower phenotype (blended colors)
	- Multiple alleles
		- Many genes exist in multiple forms and are said to have multiple alleles
		- ABo Blood Types
			- $I^A$$I^A$ or $I^A$i = A
			- $I^B$$I^B$ or $I^B$i = B
			- $I^A$$I^B$ = AB
			- ii = o
	- sex linked traits
		- Disorders carried on the X or Y chromosomes 
			- Much more common on X chromosome
		- More frequent in males than females
		- Colorblindness, hemophilia 
	- In one couple the mother is a carrier for colorblindness and the father is normal
		- Punnett Square ![[Heredity, Mendelian, Non-Mendelian Genetics 2023-03-31 14.41.29.excalidraw]]
		- Male - 50% chance of being color blind
		- Female - 50% chance of carrying the gene, no chance of being color-blind
