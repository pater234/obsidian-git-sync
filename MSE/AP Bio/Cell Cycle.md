**The Cell Cycle**
- Cells in all organisms have the same cycle
- Mitosis is PMAT, otherwise it is in interphase
	- G1 (Growth), S (growth and DNA replication), and G2 (growth and final preps for division) - interphase
	- Pro-metaphase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase
- Mitosis refers to sex cells and gametes
	- The sperm and egg form a zygote
		- The zygote undergoes mitosis
		- The sperm and egg went meiosis
- No universal name for the steps of mitosis
	- Phases = stages
- The cell is either in mitosis or interphase
	- In G1 phase
		- Replicates proteins
	- In the S phase
		- A new DNA is synthesized
		- Only chromatin is created, chromatids are created during prophase
			- Chromatin is the stringy stuff that is super coiled into DNA
		- One double-armed chromosome is created from combining two sister chromatids with a centromere
			- If you break the centromere and rip the spindle apparatus apart then they become individual single-armed chromosomes 
		- The junction of a spindle and centromere is the kinetochore
	- In the G2 phase
		- It replicates important organelles and components
- Types of cell division 
	- Binary Fission
		- Devoted to prokaryotic life
		- We are made up of eukaryotic cells
			- Membrane bound cells and nuclei 
			- Prokaryotes lack these things
		- S Phase
			- Simple DNA replication
		- Binary Fission Stage
			- Separates the two strands of DNA into two daughter cells
	- Mitosis
		- More complex than binary fission
		- We have pairs of chromosomes (23)
		- The long process ensures that replicated DNA gets to where it needs to be in a cell
			- If it goes wrong, then that is cancer
		- p53 gene
			- The guardian of the genome
				- The genome is the complete genetic library of a human
			- p53 is a locus in your genome that is devoted to making proteins and enzymes that control the cell cycle
				- Roughly 70% of all cancers have a mutation in the p53 loci
- Next class
	- Cyclins and CDKs
- Cell Cycle Checkpoints 
	- G1 checkpoint, G2 checkpoint, M checkpoint
	- G1 checkpoint - end of G1 phase
	- G2 - prevents cells from entering mitosis if they have genetic mutations
	- Apoptosis - if the cell is too far gone, then it destroys itself
	- M checkpoint - examines whether all sister chromatids are correctly attached to the spindle microtubules that separate them
